                <br><li><strong>DATA VISUALIZATION</strong></li>
                <p>Data visualization is a way to help people understand the significance of data by placing it in a visual context (turn spreadsheets or reports into charts and graphs that can be easily understood).</p>
                <p>Think of this career as a bridge between technical and non-technical roles. You're taking the data collected by analysts and transforming it into a form anyone can understand.</p>
                <p><strong>Quick facts about data visualization as a career:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Average salary: <a href="https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Data_Visualization_Engineer/Salary">$98,264</a> per year for Data Visualization Engineers</li>
                  <li>It’s in demand because employers can make sense of large amounts of data to drive real business results. For example, predict sales volume, understand what factors influence human behavior, identify areas in the business that can be improved, identify trends, relationships, patterns, etc.</li>
                  <li>It’s a blend of science and art: raw information meeting visually appealing mediums.</li>
                  <li>Data visualization is the key to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dorieclark/2014/03/10/data-visualization-is-the-future-heres-why/#397ff8fd1884">“bringing the power of Big Data to the mainstream.”</a></li>
                </ul>
                <br><li><strong>DATA ENGINEERING</strong></li>
                <p>Data engineering is separate from data science, but the former is what enables the latter to exist. Data engineers build the infrastructure and tools that data scientists rely on to conduct their own work.</p>
                <p><strong>Quick facts about data engineering as a career:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Average salary: <a href="https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Data_Engineer/Salary">$90,839 per year</a></li>
                  <li>In some ways, data engineering is more closely related to software engineering than to other data roles.</li>
                  <li>Growth of data engineering roles <a href="https://insights.dice.com/2016/09/09/growth-market-data-engineers/">has historically outpaced growth</a> for data scientist jobs.</li>
                </ul>
                <br><li><strong>UI/UX DESIGN</strong></li>
                <p>While they're in the same family, <a href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/the-difference-between-ux-and-ui-design-a-laymans-guide/">UI and UX are different</a>. UI (user interface) specialists design interfaces for websites and apps to be visually appealing, flow well, and be easy for users to navigate. UX (user experience) specialists do a lot of research and testing to consider every element of how the user will interact with the company and website, coordinating with developers and UI designers.</p>
                <p>This type of career is perfect for those who want a creative-meets-analytical type of role (graphic design meets A/B testing and so on).</p>
                <p>Ultimately, UI is better for those who want to focus on the visuals, layout, and general look and feel of a page or product. UX is better for those who want to use analysis and testing to help a business seamlessly meet their users' needs.</p>
                <p><strong>Quick facts about UI/UX as a career:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>87% of managers surveyed by Adobe said hiring more UX designers is the #1 priority for their organization.</li>
                  <li>There are 14,000 UX designer jobs in the United States alone (and 24,000 in Europe).</li>
                  <li>UX and UI designers have many specific tools of the trade–like these design programs.</li>
                  <li>Demand for UX/UI skills is mostly in mobile platforms, but demand for innovative design in VR, AR, AI, and wearables is growing.</li>
                </ul>
                <br><li><strong>NETWORK AND INFORMATION SECURITY (CYBERSECURITY)</strong></li>
                <p>For any company that collects customer information or deals with sensitive data of their own, keeping networks secure is paramount.</p>
                <p>When data breaches do happen, they can be big, newsworthy, and costly for the company to recover from. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/2017-biggest-hacks-so-far/">2017 had its fair share of cybersecurity disasters</a>, and companies famously hacked in the past include Sony, LinkedIn, Chipotle, and others.</p>
                <p>These situations underscore just how critical it is for companies to keep their network security up to par, and make cybersecurity one of the most-needed jobs and one of the tech skills in demand in 2019. Unfortunately for those companies, right now there is a shortage of people trained in network security. Fortunately for you, that means there's a gap in the market you can fill.</p>
                <p>If you’re curious about filling that gap, read my <a href="https://learntocodewith.me/posts/cybersecurity/">ultimate guide to starting a career in cybersecurity</a>.</p>

                <br><li><strong>IOT</strong></li>
                <p>In the broadest sense, the term IoT encompasses everything connected to the internet, but it is increasingly being used to define objects that “talk” to each other.</p>
                <p>“Simply, the Internet of Things is made up of devices—from simple sensors to smartphones and wearables—connected together,” <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/internet-of-things-what-is-explained-iot">says Matthew Evans</a>, the IoT program head at techUK.
                Everything that's connected to the internet can be hacked, which is why security is one top concern with these devices. A report from Samsung says the need to secure every connected device by 2020 is “critical” and that more than 7.3 billion devices will need to be made secure by their manufacturers before 2020. <a href="https://learntocodewith.me/posts/cybersecurity/">Cybersecurity professionals</a> who specialize in IoT will likely be highly sought after for this reason.</p>

                <p>If you’re okay with a little uncertainty in your career (and you enjoy science fiction), quantum computing is a field to consider. “The industry has a ways to go,” <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/national-quantum-initiative-quantum-computing-jobs/">writes Sophia Chen</a>. “They have a timeline, sort of, give or take a few decades. And at the moment, their roadmap has at least one glaring pothole: a lack of trained people.”</p>
                <p>However, this provides an opportunity for you to help move the needle forward. Jeremy O’Brien, physicist and professorial research fellow at the University of Bristol, says that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/02/23/20-mind-boggling-facts-about-quantum-computing-everyone-should-read/#5d4a77c55edb">quantum computers could outperform everyday computers</a> in less than 10 years.</p>
