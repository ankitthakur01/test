              <p><br>Augmented reality (AR) is an interactive experience of a real-world environment where the objects that reside in the real world are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information, sometimes across multiple sensory modalities, including visual, auditory, haptic, somatosensory and olfactory. AR can be defined as a system that fulfills three basic features: a combination of real and virtual worlds, real-time interaction, and accurate 3D registration of virtual and real objects.</p>
              <p>The overlaid sensory information can be constructive (i.e. additive to the natural environment), or destructive (i.e. masking of the natural environment). This experience is seamlessly interwoven with the physical world such that it is perceived as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immersion_(virtual_reality)">immersive</a> aspect of the real environment. In this way, augmented reality alters one's ongoing perception of a real-world environment, whereas <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality">virtual reality</a> completely replaces the user's real-world environment with a simulated one Augmented reality is related to two largely synonymous terms: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_reality">mixed reality</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-mediated_reality">computer-mediated reality</a>.</p>
              <p>Augmented reality is used to enhance natural environments or situations and offer perceptually enriched experiences. With the help of advanced AR technologies (e.g. adding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision">computer vision</a>, incorporating AR cameras into smartphone applications and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_object_recognition">object recognition</a>) the information about the surrounding real world of the user becomes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactivity">interactive</a> and digitally manipulated. Information about the environment and its objects is overlaid on the real world. This information can be virtual or real, e.g. seeing other real sensed or measured information such as electromagnetic radio waves overlaid in exact alignment with where they actually are in space.</p>
              <p>Augmented reality also has a lot of potential in the gathering and sharing of tacit knowledge. Augmentation techniques are typically performed in real time and in semantic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_awareness">contexts</a> with environmental elements. Immersive perceptual information is sometimes combined with supplemental information like scores over a live video feed of a sporting event. This combines the benefits of both augmented reality technology and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-up_display">heads up display</a> technology (HUD).</p>
              <p>Virtual reality (VR) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation">simulated</a> experience that can be similar to or completely different from the real world. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality_applications">Applications of virtual reality</a> can include entertainment (i.e. gaming) and educational purposes (i.e. medical or military training).</p>
              <p>Currently standard virtual reality systems use either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality_headset">virtual reality headsets</a> or multi-projected environments to generate realistic images, sounds and other sensations that simulate a user's physical presence in a virtual environment. A person using virtual reality equipment is able to look around the artificial world, move around in it, and interact with virtual features or items. The effect is commonly created by VR headsets consisting of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-mounted_display">head-mounted display</a> with a small screen in front of the eyes, but can also be created through specially designed rooms with multiple large screens. Virtual reality typically incorporates auditory and video feedback, but may also allow other types of sensory and force feedback through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptic_technology">haptic technology</a>.</p>
              <p>For the 2018 year it was common to consider VR (virtual reality software) to be the most significant achievement of our generation. However, the situation has dramatically changed. VR proved to have a limited range of application among the companies and the customers. Therefore, the experts forecast the overcoming of VR by the AR (augmented reality software) soon.</p>
              <p>The AR technologies will continue to be profitable for enterprise software development. In 2019, AR will become more common for mobile devices. Unlike VR, it does not require headsets. Therefore, the AR’s ability to be deployed on mobile phones and tablets is far more robust.</p>
              <p>Also, it is expected that AR will change the spheres of marketing and advertising in the upcoming year. AR provides a completely personal experience. Thus, customers’ engagement is skyrocketing. A consistent communication channel for direct dialogue between the customer and provider will be ensured using the AR developments. Probably, AR will also reinforce its position in the area of manufacturing. Industrial AR platforms help the manufacturers to visualize data sets and provide assistance in jobs related to physical labor. It is predicted that AR software will become a key to the transformation of this sphere.</p>
